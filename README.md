- sample_code	maize_inclusion_perc: 
- afla_level: clean (clean maize without mycotoxin contamination), contam (maize contaminated with mycotoxins), CONTROL (clean maize used in substrate), HIGH (high mycotoxin contamination), LOW (low mycotoxin contamination)
- sample_type: Raw maize (maize used in this study for generation of substrates), frass, larvae (harvested larvae), substrate (mixture of raw maize and agri-food byproducts)
- replicate: biological replicate
- unit: ug/kg (microgram per kg, as is)
- remaining columns are the different mycotoxins, see manuscript and SI
